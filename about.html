Bulacan is a province in the Philippines located in the Central Luzon region, just north of Metro Manila. Known as the "Land of the Heroes," it is celebrated for its historical significance, being the birthplace of prominent Filipino revolutionaries such as Marcelo H. del Pilar and Gregorio del Pilar. The province played a pivotal role during the Philippine Revolution against Spanish rule and was the site of the Malolos Congress, where the first Philippine Constitution was drafted.

Bulacan is also renowned for its thriving industries, including crafts like leather, jewelry, and fireworks, as well as its culinary heritage, featuring delicacies like pastillas de leche, ensaymada, and savory dishes like kare-kare. Its natural attractions include scenic rivers, caves, and mountains, making it a blend of historical, cultural, and ecological wonders.
